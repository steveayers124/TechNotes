ApacheSparkEssT.txt
a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing
began as a design for data science
but now use cases include realtime stream event processing
-SparkSQL -SparkStreaming -MLlib (machine learning) -GraphX


Completed a course on Lynda! Apache Spark Essential Training


Speed (DAG engine), Ease of use (Java, Scala, R, Python, ANSI SQL) [Tableau connects directly using SparkSQL], Generality, Platform agnostic nature
text_file = spark.textFile("hdfs://...")
text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split())
  .map(lambda word: (word, 1))
  .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a+b)
# word count in Spark's Python API, pySpark
