# Cumulative joins in a query require caution that you don't invalidate results
SELECT a.val, b.val, c.val
FROM a
JOIN b ON (a.key = b.key)
LEFT OUTER JOIN c ON (a.key = c.key)
# So the first in an inner join, and then we join additional info from c to those results.


LEFT SEMI JOIN is like ANSI SQL clause EXISTS
--------------

FROM a
